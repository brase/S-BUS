#SBUS

This implementation of an SBUS reader is based on the one of easterbunny273: [MulticopterFramework](https://github.com/easterbunny273/MulticopterFramework)
I have tested it on an arduino due with a FrSky X8R.
To get it working you need to invert the signal. I used a 74HC14N.

More information on the protocoll can be found [here](http://developer.mbed.org/users/Digixx/notebook/futaba-s-bus-controlled-by-mbed/).
